# A Copious and Critical English-Latin Dictionary

**English-Latin** dictionary of Smith & Hall (1871). _Draft version._

Another digital edition of this dictionary was made by [Johan Winge](https://github.com/Alatius), his version is available on-line on the [web-site Latinitium][1]. As of the current date (2019-03-11) it can be more correct and reliable.

## Work plans

The ongoing transcribe project is far from completeness, so the text still contains OCR errors and lack of formatting. I do not plan to make improvements to my XDXF version till significant progress of proofreading.
