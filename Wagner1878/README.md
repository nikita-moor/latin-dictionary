## Sources

This dictionary bases on the French edition published in 1878 year (with triple index) and being transcribed for Gutenberd project (2017–):
    
1. Wagner, Franz S. J.; Borgnet, Auguste. _Lexicon latinum seu Corpus Phraseologiæ._ Brugis, 1878. URL: <https://archive.org/details/LexiconLatinum> \[Accessed 4 March 2019\].
1. On-going transcribe project. URL: <https://www.pgdp.net/c/project.php?id=projectID5b3d9b5f27ee1> \[Accessed 4 March 2019\].


## Usage guidelines

Format and structure of the dictionary hardly fit the XDXF format, so this _draft_ edition fails test agains DTD schema and probably will diverge more from the XDXF format in future editions. This file was tested only in [GoldenDict][1] and could be incompatible with other dictionary shells. It is strongly adviced using additional styles for GoldenDict (hide/show full article), see `article-style.css` file.

[GoldenDict][1] dictionary application supports normalization of input words (pæne > paene; prāva > pravus). We recommend using ["Latin spelling and hyphenation dictionaries"][2] in combination with our Döderlein's dictionary.

ToDo: Creative Commons or other compatible with Guttenberg…


## Development schedule

This draft bases on the WIP version of the transcript and I am not going to do any improvements till the 1st part of the dictionary be finished.

Current state of the transcript project (2018-03-04):

* Parts 1–2 — Formatting round (F2)
* Parts 3–18 — Profreading round (P2–P3)

By the most optimistic variant, Part 1 will be released in 2-3 months, by pessimistic — can be delayed for years. For example, ["A Smaller Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities"][3] is in Post-Processing since 2011.

Anyway, I am open for suggestions about formatting, or noticed errors in the text.
